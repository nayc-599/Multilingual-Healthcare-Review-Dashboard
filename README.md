## Project Description
An end-to-end NLP pipeline designed to make Russian-language patient healthcare reviews accessible to English-speaking researchers, analysts and policymakers – without requiring Russian language expertise from the end user.

## Purpose
Understanding patient experiences is critical for improving healthcare quality, yet sourcing a suitable dataset for this kind of analysis is a common challenge. No English-language dataset of healthcare facility reviews was available that met the requirements of this project. A Russian-language dataset was identified as the closest suitable alternative, making translation a necessary first step rather than an optional one.
This project addresses that constraint by:

- Translating Russian healthcare facility reviews into English, making the data usable for English-speaking analysis
- Extracting the top 10 topics to identify the dominant themes and key pain points
- Summarising representative reviews to provide human-readable snapshots of real patient sentiment
