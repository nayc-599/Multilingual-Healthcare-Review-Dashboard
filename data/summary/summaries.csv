0,1," A patient was forced to pay 400 rubles to pay for a blood test at her doctor's office . The patient was told she owed the cashier for the blood test, but Kassir said she wouldn't take payment for any other procedure until I paid her first . The doctor refused to talk to the patient at all and left the office, she said .","Today, at your doctor's address, he came to do a blood test, he gave the cost of the procedure the necessary amount of money. She wrote to the registrar. She wrote a document that I needed to pay in the cashier's office. He went to the cashier's office to pay and the cashier told me that I owed her 400 rubles today. more so that I had been opened earlier in your medical centre. The hospital sheet. I told the cashier that I had to pay for the blood test now. I had to pay for the blood test. Next afternoon, I had a doctor's doctor's appointment for the doctor's office, and I had to pay for the doctor's services in the hospital, and for the amount of money in the hospital. Kassir told me that she wouldn't take any payment for any other procedure in your medical centre until I paid her first the debt of 400 rubles. On Monday, at the terminal, they took the pediatrician's card on Wednesday, and we arrived at the scheduled time, and the office was closed, and the register said that this doctor on leave would be accepted in the next office, and in the next office, the doctor would take his registered patients, so we would have to wait for those who were registered to their doctor, and then we would also have us registered to the doctor who was on vacation, and then we would sit for 45 minutes to take a referral to the tests, and I think it's disrespect for both the patients and the doctors who have to listen to the patients not happy about it. On the website of this pharmacy, it's been a long time since the ads about the non-existent gifts in ordering products for a certain amount of money. Asked me to remove the obsolete information from the pages of the site. There was no reaction. Admit it, it's not nice when we're being lied to. Also, a phone call on the website was answered by an employee who had a bo-o-more difficulty explaining where the pharmacy was located. Today, I've had an unforgettable experience from our clinic. There's no doctor in the precinct, I've been asked in the register to register with another doctor for an hour. They gave me a paperwork, they sent me to 208 offices. After an hour and a half and a half, I've been told that you're going to the office to pick up a tabloid, and that you didn't get a ticket. The doctor refused to talk to me at all and left the office. The nurse tried to explain that I only needed a referral to a narrow specialist, she sends you back to the register office, because this is the doctor on duty, and you have to go to a therapist. It's awful, but I want to ask the management of the clinic why you created an electronic record if you still need to stand up to the therapist so that she can press the button and write you down to the specialists. And so you go back to the office, because it's not patient and it's not patient, but it's not that kind of an organization. And if you're also a visitor, you're doomed, and no matter that you have a Moscow med policy that your employer gave you and you get properly deducted from your pay and paid into Moscow's budget, you have no right to be treated for anything, neither the doctors nor the registrars have any idea what the Mandatory Health Insurance Act is, it doesn't apply to their own laws and orders.

2,4, I've cured a few teeth from Dr. Kurilov Evgenia Anatolievich at the clinic in Mayakovsky . I'm very pleased with the competence of the doctor and the clinic as a whole . I think I'm just lucky with a doctor!,"I've just had an unexpected positive experience with dental clinics, and I've come across a forum where people exchange impressions on the subject, and I've also wanted to share it. Here, I share and recommend. I've cured a few teeth (including those launched) from Dr. Kurilov Evgenia Anatolievich at the clinic in Mayakovsky. I've been very happy. If you're usually going to see a dentist, it's not even close. It's done at the highest professional level. It's actually not painful. It's quick and good. And if you can say it's a dentist's appointment, I just liked it! I've been taking a long time to see a dentist, I've been picking up a clinic. I don't regret it. I think I'm just lucky with a doctor! A couple of weeks ago, I decided to set up a bracelet system. The doctor picked it up on a friend's recommendation. Seven years ago, I had a similar treatment in another clinic, but it didn't work. So I decided to try again. I really liked how Catherine interacted with the patient, she took pictures before the setup, analyzed my panoramic X-rays, set me up braces very quickly, and explained to me all aspects of hygiene care. I'm very pleased with the competence of the doctor and the clinic as a whole. I found out about the B-Clinique from a girl in the forum, and we got all the correspondence, and she was doing the abdomino, and she told me to go to the same place. I don't know who it was, and I really liked it, and I decided to go to a clinic with different doctors, and both of us were at the highest level, and I didn't expect to. The doctor, Robert Waganovich, Mamiconian, came from the other side of Moscow because she had been looking for a doctor and a friend recently told her how well she had been cured of her front tooth in this clinic. She also went there to treat my friend's husband and a few other people she knew. And in the footsteps of all these people, I went to a lot of dentists now, but I didn't find a solution to her problem. The doctors seemed to me to be openly imposing additional services, and because the budget is limited and untrustworthy, I couldn't accept treatment. At Mirana Dent, I liked it right away. The sit-in, everybody smiles. The doctor made the most positive and pleasant impression. The master's expert explained and explained everything, completely free of puffs and arrogance, which, alas, is so common to many doctors in private clinics. Hello, we've been seen in Zubrecka for a long time, too, and we're all very excited about it. We're not gonna do anything extra, very good people, they're gonna tell us everything, and the kid's gonna love it, we're gonna go to the dentist, and we're gonna go to the party, and, of course, we've all been, and we've sometimes treated a tooth and warned about the condition of the treatment because they say that the tooth is milky, he can react differently to the treatment, but we've all got a normal toothbrush before today, and we've already got it, so I'm telling you to go to Zurenka, it's a really good clinic.",2161,1832,329,"Competent Dentists, Painless Procedures, Thorough Explanations, Friendly Staff, Clear Hygiene Guidance",Dental Clinic Services,84.78,15.22

4,13," On November 22, 2015, a gynaecologist said that there is a minimum edema of the placenta, and that there would be no cure . When I got the bleeding, I didn't. And yet after ultrasound, I began to wonder what I'm doing, . First the miracle doctor said go pee in a can, then the doctor came out and 30 minutes later the baby was dead .","Hello, I had a pregnancy for 11.5 weeks. On November 22, 2015, around 11 p.m., I myself arrived with smoldering marks of dark brown colour and the pain of the stomach. After my examination and ultrasound, a gynaecologist, if I can't remember him, remembers only Vladislav's name, said that there is a minimum edema of the placenta, and that there would be a plaster of the placenta, and that there would be no cure. When I got the bleeding, I didn't. And yet after ultrasound, I began to wonder what I'm doing, and that I can't hear the ercebia of the fruit, saying that it may not be so, and that it can see 9 weeks. (I'll say that three days before that I've planned to visit my doctor in the VC, and I've said it was all right, perfect time and heartbeat.) And I had to ask what I would do in the morning. So let me start my story. On April 14, 2015, I started bleeding for 19 weeks of pregnancy. The baby moved. This was the third pregnancy. It started. It started. First the miracle doctor said go pee in a can. I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I didn't want to pee. Then I was sent out and 30 minutes later. The doctor came out. The baby was dead. It was 15.02 to 18.02.2010 in an infective boxing unit with a child of 3.5 ms, with a diagnosis of bronchitis. I heard many good reviews about the other wards of this hospital, but God wouldn't let us get into the box. For the sake of the child's health, a lot can be borne: sleep in a chair, not bathing well (for mothers), running into a basement in a single toilet for moms. What they call boxing is 18 m2 with glasses, sometimes with windows set up, with rabid batteries in which there are 12. There were cases of 15.02 to 18.02.2010 in an infective boxing unit with a child of 3.5 months with a diagnosis of bronchitis. There were many good reviews of the other wards of this hospital, but God would not allow them to enter the box. For the sake of the child's health, many things can be carried out: sleep in a chair, not bathing well (for moms there is no provision), running into a basement in one room if they were alone in the toilet. What they call boxing is 18 m2 with windows, and rabid batteries, and we were kept in a place where there were 12 people, and where there was nothing to breathe, and where there was no need to breathe. In these conditions they treated children with ODS, pneumonia and bronchite, they tried to knock down the temperature of their house, and they were trying to wait for them. My child started having a balcony with leopard, so that he was imperly mothed, while I was trying to open the door to the nurse's room, and there was not enough to be told after that they said to eat our children. I've been asked the symptoms. I've called the temperature, the cold, the cough, the vomiting. When I said the stink of the years, I've added ""probably because of the temperature."" We've been treated in infection number one for a very long time. The baby's temperature was 38.5 years. When the baby's been moved to the floor, we've been put into a room where there was a scary spiritual wall, and we've been put into a room where it wasn't so bad. They've told me to wait for the duty doctor. I didn't immediately understand where we were and why it was so hot. The room wasn't very big. The white peeler, which hardly changes after looking at the new ones.

Our Children &apos; s Clinic No. 53 (DGP No. 143) has recently been renovated, but how pleasantly surprised we were when we came to the pediatrician &apos; s day to see that the clinic had been equipped with new modern furniture. Thank you to the management for taking care of young patients and their parents. It is now a pleasure to go to the health centre. It's a long time since everyone's ever loved medicacy, and it's a center in Moscow, where you get a lot of pleasure, and you feel like you're a KOPOLOV. After repeated delivery of blood to the plasma at St. Begoway's, I got a call to my mobile phone from the blood transfusion station, and it was funny that I had leukemia and I had to come back to the blood transfusion station on 26 April 2013 for an examination. But I did come to the station itself to get the results. But at the blood transfusion station in the window on the second floor, the girl also said that it was funny that I had leukemia, and I had to come back on 26 April 2013 for further examination. And again, I didn't get the results of the analysis on paper or electronically. If you're talking about a serious diagnosis like leukemia, you have to do the analysis, not scare the human being. My request in electronic form to send me my blood results, confirming the leukemia diagnosis, the blood transfusion station (art. m Begova) ignored. I was shocked by this service, and I prayed that I wouldn't get there, but I didn't see much of it in the village when I was a kid, and the servants are stables and shepherds who treat you like cattle, and they give birth there like cattle don't give you the good of dying.",10,2,8,"Limited Pediatric Staff, Delayed Treatment, No Phone Updates, Overcrowded Wards, Poor Management Oversight",Other,20.0,80.0
